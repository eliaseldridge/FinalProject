# Golf Trainer
Golf Trainer is a web application that invites users to share with it the issues they are experiencing with their golf game. Golf is a sport that is impossible to perfect. As much as you play, work, and train, there is always something that can be worked on. And any casual golfer knows, one day you could be unstoppable, and the next you could be facing your worst round of the season. This application helps remind you of the fundamentals and walk you through areas to think about to improve/fix your golf skills. This application was based on the SnapTutor application introduced in Dr. Colin Conrad's MGMT 4620 course at Dalhousie University.

# How to Open
1. (Mac) Navigate to the "GolfTrainer" file folder that you have downloaded, but do not open it. Instead, right click this folder and select "New Terminal Tab at Folder" on the drop down menu. This will open Terminal and allow access to the file. (Windows) Navigate to the "GolfTrainer" file folder that you have downloaded and open it. Inside the folder, right click any open space and select "Open in Terminal" and this will open Terminal and allow access to the file (Tech Tips, 2022). 
*Note* I am doing this via Mac, so my explanation for Windows is all based on research.
2. Inside Terminal, enter "python -m flask --app GolfTrainer run". (This is case sensitive)
3. If this works, one of the 9-30 lines that output on Terminal should say "* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Enter http://127.0.0.1:5000 into a search engine (Chrome works best)
4. Hit enter and you should see a webpage that is headed with a lovely picture of a golf ball and golf club sitting on top of some grass with the title "Golf Trainer" right below it

# Sample Output
You should expect approximately five to seven different ways to solve your problem from the program. Here is a sample output when typing "I keep slicing my 9-iron" into the prompt box:

    "To fix your slice with the 9-iron, you can try the following tips: 1. **Grip**: Check your grip on the club. Make sure your grip is not too tight, as this can lead to a slice. Try to grip the club more lightly and in a neutral position. 2. **Alignment**: Ensure that your body and clubface are aligned correctly towards the target. Misalignment can cause the clubface to open at impact, leading to a slice. 3. **Swing Path**: Focus on swinging the club on an inside-out path. This means that the club should approach the ball from the inside and then move out towards the target. This will help eliminate the side spin that causes a slice. 4. **Weight Transfer**: Pay attention to your weight transfer during the swing. Make sure you are shifting your weight properly from your back foot to your front foot, allowing you to deliver the clubface square at impact. 5. **Practice**: Spend some time practicing with your 9-iron. Focus on making smooth, controlled swings and implementing the above tips. Practice will help you develop muscle memory and improve your ball-striking consistency. 6. **Video Analysis**: Record your swing and analyze it to see if there are any obvious flaws causing the slice. You can compare your swing to instructional videos online to make adjustments. By working on these aspects of your game, you should see an improvement in your ability to hit straighter shots with your 9-iron."

# Why This is Important
Improving at the sport of golf is a great source of confidence for many people. As the game is so difficult and so technical, the outcome of your abilities can be so volatile on not only a day-to-day basis, but a hole-to-hole basis.
