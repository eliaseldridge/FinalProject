# Golf Trainer
Golf Trainer is a web application that invites users to share with it the issues they are experiencing with their golf game. Golf is a sport that is impossible to perfect. As much as you play, work, and train, there is always something that can be worked on. And any casual golfer knows, one day you could be unstoppable, and the next you could be facing your worst round of the season. This application helps remind you of the fundamentals and walk you through areas to think about to improve/fix your golf skills.

# How to Open
1. (Mac) Navigate to the "GolfTrainer" file folder that you have downloaded, but do not open it. Instead, right click this folder and select "New Terminal Tab at Folder" on the drop down menu. This will open Terminal and allow access to the file. (Windows) Navigate to the "GolfTrainer" file folder that you have downloaded and open it. Inside the folder, right click any open space and select "Open in Terminal" and this will open Terminal and allow access to the file (Tech Tips, 2022). 
*Note* I am doing this via Mac, so my explanation for Windows is all based on research.
2. Inside Terminal, enter "python -m flask --app GolfTrainer run". (This is case sensitive)
3. If this works, one of the ~9 lines that output on Terminal should say "* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000. Enter http://127.0.0.1:5000 into a search engine (Chrome works best)
4. Hit enter and you should see a webpage that is headed with a lovely picture of a golf ball and golf club sitting on top of some grass with the title "Golf Trainer" right below it

# Why This is Important
Improving at the sport of golf is a great source of confidence for many people. As the game is so difficult and so technical, the outcome of your abilities can be so volatile on not only a day-to-day basis, but a hole-to-hole basis. However, this builds a lot of diffeent skills that go beyond the golf course. (Wengenmeir, 2023)
